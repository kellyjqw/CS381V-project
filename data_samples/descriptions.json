Color remains white/ivory. Texture ranges from smooth, billowy to dry and firm with no liquid. Whipped yolks or whole eggs with sugar: pale yellow, thick, and airy, forming ribbons that slowly disappear.

Midway: bubbles form; a gloss appears as some sugar dissolves; grains still persist at the surface or in suspension. The texture shifts toward a creamy, speckled slurry with translucent pockets where sugar dissolves. The whipper attends fluidity, adds sugar slowly in a steady stream, tilting the bowl to gauge dissolution and air incorporation.",

When sugar is creamed with butter, the mixture is pale, ivory, fluffy, and smooth, with increased volume and fine, barely visible crystals. When sugar is whisked into egg whites (meringue), the mix becomes glossy and stiff peaks hold their shape; the sugar is fully dissolved. After whipping sugar, the person might be scraping the bowl, wiping the whisk, or proceeding to fold in butter for frosting, or pipe meringue."

Air begins to trap in pockets, giving a speckled, foamy surface. The person is mashing or whisking, stirring with a spoon or whisk, pulsing in a blender to break down fruit.",
        "finished_description": "In culinary use, \"whipping strawberry\" typically yields a pale pink, glossy foam or mousse. If fruit is whipped alone, you get a light, airy puree with soft peaks; if whipped with cream and/or sugar, you obtain a smooth mousse or whipped cream with pink tinge.
