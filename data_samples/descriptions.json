    "roasting_beet": {
        "progress_description": "Start: Whole beets are round to oblong, 1.5\u20133 in diameter, with taut smooth purple-red skin; greens attached; extremely firm and dense to the touch.\n\nEarly progress: Skins may blister or wrinkle; surface moisture beads; color can deepen at exposed edges; beets may shrink slightly as moisture migrates.\n \nCut pieces (if used): Exposed faces are pale purple and moist; cut surfaces show slight browning at heat-exposed edges.\n \nWhat the worker does: washes, trims greens, peels or leaves skins on, tosses with oil/salt, lays on sheet or foil, rotates tray, and probes with a fork for initial resistance.",
        "finished_description": "End state: beets are fully roasted\u2014tender when pierced; skins loosen and peel away with light rubbing. The surface shows caramelization and a glossy glaze from oil; exterior is deep ruby-brown, interior vibrant magenta and uniformly soft with a creamy to jammy center. They may have shrunk slightly but remain whole or halved. After roasting, the person cools them, then peels as needed and slices, dices, or pur\u00e9es for serving or a salad."

    "roasting_mushroom": {
        "progress_description": "Start state: whole mushrooms, caps smooth and domed, colors white to light brown, stems intact; surface dry and firm. In-progress observations: caps soften and lie flatter, edges may curl up; shrinking occurs as moisture evaporates; surface becomes slightly shiny from oil or moisture; mushrooms release liquid that pools on the sheet; some translucence in the stems; color shifts to pale or light tan, with blotches as heat progresses. Action by the worker: trim stems, cut for even size, toss with oil/seasoning, spread on a sheet, flip halfway, monitor texture and moisture.",
        "finished_description": "End state: roasted mushrooms show golden-brown to deep amber surfaces, glossy with rendered oil; caps slightly shrunk and wrinkled, edges crisp, centers tender; color varies by piece; moisture largely evaporated with modest size reduction. Texture: crisp exterior, moist, tender interior. When finished, the annotator would see mushrooms on a tray or plate, likely being transferred to a serving dish, possibly tossed with butter or oil, and the oven may be turned off while they inspect for doneness."
