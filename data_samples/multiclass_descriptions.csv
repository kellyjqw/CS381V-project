rolling_dough,"Initial state: a pale, cream-colored dough lump, roughly round or irregular, fist-sized, resting on a lightly floured surface. It feels soft, elastic, and slightly tacky, with a few surface creases and flour dusting. The dough is cohesive but malleable. The beginner’s action: placing the lump on the board, dusting hands and top with flour, and gently patting or pressing to loosen edges, starting to flatten it.","In-progress dough shows a transitioning surface being flattened. Shape is evolving from a puck to a round or oblong sheet; edges may taper as thickness evens. Color is pale beige with a light flour dusting and a subtle sheen. Texture ranges from tacky-soft to smooth and springy, with visible fingerprints or slight compressions. The baker uses a rolling pin with steady downward pressure, rotating dough between passes to maintain uniform thickness.","End state: a uniformly rolled dough sheet or disk with even thickness, clean trimmed edges, light flour dusting, pale beige color, smooth and pliable surface, slight sheen, and no cracks. Post-rolling actions: the person inspects and trims edges, cuts shapes or portions, and transfers the sheet to a baking tray or pan, or covers and chills it as needed."
rolling_fondant,"Initial state: fondant in a solid block or lump, color uniform (white/ivory or pastel), at room temperature. Surface smooth and matte; consistency firm but pliable, slightly tacky if warmed. Size varies (block or 1–2 lb portion). A beginner unpacks it from packaging, breaks off a chunk, and begins to knead it on a clean, lightly dusted surface to soften before rolling.","During rolling, fondant forms a progressively flat, circular or oval sheet larger than the block. The surface becomes smooth with a subtle satin sheen; color stays uniform, though tiny marbling or specks may appear. Thickness becomes more even, with edges still slightly irregular. The fondant feels pliable and elastic, yielding to gentle pressure without tearing. The person rolls with a pin, rotates the sheet, and dusts lightly with starch to prevent sticking, lifting to check evenness.","End state: a flat sheet of fondant with uniform thickness, smooth surface, clean edges, and pliable yet firm consistency. Color is uniform and fully rolled, with no cracks or air bubbles; size allows easy draping or cutting into decorations. The person finished with rolling fondant might be smoothing the sheet onto a cake with a fondant smoother, trimming edges, and attaching decorations or cutting shapes."
rolling_pastry,"Initial state: a chilled pastry dough in a disk or slab, pale ivory to light beige, with a light dusting of flour on top and at the edges. It feels cool, firm yet pliable, not sticky. Size ranges from palm-sized to a small handful. The baker is starting: placing the dough on a floured board, lightly dusting the top with flour, and giving it gentle taps or presses to bring it into a workable form before rolling begins.","Intermediate rolling state shows a gradually expanding sheet of dough. Surface is pale cream, matte, lightly flour-dusted, with visible rolling-pin impressions. The sheet is thin and pliable, elastic to touch, with a slightly translucent center and thicker, uneven edges. The dough may exhibit subtle color uniformity as it expands. The roller presses downward, rolls, and rotates the dough to even thickness, dusts with flour, and occasionally lifts and repositions to maintain shape; edges become straighter but not perfectly uniform.","End state: a flat, evenly rolled sheet of pastry, uniform thickness across the surface, typically rectangular or round to fit the recipe; color pale cream with a slight sheen, smooth texture, minimal flour dust, straight, clean edges; pliable but not sticky, consistent from edge to edge, ready for filling or shaping. The person finished might be trimming stray edges, placing the sheet into a pan or onto a work surface, chilling it, or brushing with egg wash before baking."
rolling_meatball,"Initial state: A small, loosely packed lump of raw ground meat, about 1.5–2 inches across, pale pink with fat flecks, moist and slightly glossy, texture coarse and unbound. The person starts by cupping a portion in their hands, gathering and gently pressing it, and beginning to roll it between palms.","Mid-roll, the meatball shows a partially formed sphere with irregular contours. Its surface is damp and glossy, with visible flecks of fat and herbs; color ranges from pink to light beige, interior still raw. Size increases as rolling continues, but the form remains asymmetric, with flat spots where it was pressed against the work surface. The texture is tacky and cohesive, with air pockets. The person rotates and compresses the mass with cupped palms, smoothing and re-shaping as needed.","End state: a single, well-formed meatball, compact and smooth, about 1.5–2 inches in diameter. Uniform color—pale pinkish-gray raw inside, with a slightly matte to lightly glossy exterior depending on moisture; no cracks. The person finished rolling might be transferring the ball to a baking sheet or pan, placing it among others, or moving it toward the stove to sauté or simmer."
rolling_clay,"Initial state: a small lump or ball of clay, irregular but compact, palm-sized or smaller. Color matches the material (earthy terracotta, gray, brown, or bright polymer). Surface is slightly damp and cool to the touch; texture is soft yet cohesive, with gentle give under finger pressure. The beginner is likely warming it in both hands, kneading to distribute moisture, and shaping or rotating the lump to test pliability.","Mid-roll, clay forms an elongated sheet or softened cylinder, with thickness uneven where pressure varies. The surface shows linear roll marks, smooth patches, tiny ridges, and occasional air pockets. Color darkens where damp, lightens as moisture dries, with a subtle gloss from slip. Edges may be rounded or tapered. The worker rolls back and forth, rotates the mass, and uses palms or fingers to even surface, pinch edges, and check thickness.","End state: A rolled clay piece appears cohesive and uniform. Shape is a defined form—straight cylinder, long coil, or flat slab—with consistent thickness and a smooth, seamless surface. Color is even across the piece, without stray bits, and the surface is either matte or slightly polished depending on finish. The material is pliable but firm (leather-hard to plastic), not crumbly. The maker might be smoothing edges, trimming, or preparing to stack, join, or sculpt further."
rolling_cake,"Initial state: A cooled, flat sponge sheet—rectangular, large enough to roll (roughly 30–40 cm by 40–50 cm). Color pale golden to light tan; surface matte with tiny air pockets; crumb soft, springy, slightly elastic; thin dusting of flour or parchment residue along the surface. For starting: The baker positions the sheet on parchment, spreads an even filling along one long edge, then begins to lift that edge and roll toward the opposite side, using the parchment to guide.","Intermediates show a flexible, pale-cream cylinder taking shape as the sponge wraps around a visible filling line. The roll's diameter varies along its length; one side bulges with filling, the other tapers. Surfaces are slightly tacky, with a fine flour-dusting and a faint sheen from moisture. Crumbs cling to edges; seams are not yet fully sealed. The baker uses a guiding hand and rolling pin to tighten, straighten edges, and redistribute filling, occasionally lifting to re-center the roll.","End state: a neat, uniform cylinder about 25 cm long and 4–6 cm in diameter, pale golden sponge rolled with a visible spiral of filling. Exterior smooth, sometimes lightly dusted with powdered sugar or glaze. Texture moist, springy, and sliceable with clean edges. The person finished with rolling cake is likely plating portions on a dessert plate or serving."
rolling_bread,"Initial state: Dough portions sit on a lightly floured working surface. They are pale beige and smooth but slightly tacky, shaped as round or oblong balls about 2–3 inches in diameter, with a soft, elastic texture when pressed. The surface may show faint flour dusting. The dough looks unmoved and ready to begin rolling. The person starting will dust the surface and rolling pin with flour, place a dough portion down, and apply gentle, even pressure to begin flattening.","In progress, the dough forms a flat, elongated sheet or cylinder, with taper at the ends. The surface is pale beige, flour-dusted, with a faint sheen and visible roller marks or fine wrinkles where it stretched. Thickness is uneven yet controlled, from sheet-thin to mid-thickness as pressure is applied. It feels pliable, elastic, and tacky but not sticky; when pressed it rebounds. The handler uses a rolling pin to rotate and re-dust, nudging edges to even thickness and smoothness.","End state: A uniform, cylindrical dough log about 25–30 cm long and 6–8 cm in diameter, with a smooth, lightly floured surface. Color pale beige; pliable, tacky but not sticky; ends rounded; seam along the bottom where edges were joined. The person finished with rolling might place it seam-side down into a loaf pan or proofing basket and cover to rise."
rolling_pasta,"Initial state: a pale, flour-dusted dough ball resting on a floured counter. Size roughly palm-sized, about 2–3 inches in diameter (5–8 cm). Color pale yellow-beige from semolina/flour. Texture soft, elastic, and slightly tacky but not sticky; surface may show small cracks as it rests. The rolling process hasn’t begun; a wooden rolling pin sits nearby, hands poised to press and flatten to start rolling.","Intermediates show a long, pliable sheet or ribbon with uneven edges. Shape: rectangular but irregular near the ends; width depends on roller setting. Size: length longer than the sheet; thickness gradually thins with passes. Color: pale tan from flour, with translucent bands where thinner. Consistency: tacky, elastic, and slightly crack-prone if over-stretched; surface may be matte with fine roller lines and a light flour dusting. The person feeds dough through rollers, guiding and tensioning as they roll.","End state: flat, uniform sheets of pasta dough with even thickness, pale yellow color, smooth surface, straight edges, and light flour dusting; pliable but not sticky. Ready for cutting or filling. The person might now slice them into lasagna sheets or ribbons (fettuccine, tagliatelle), trim edges, or lay sheets to dry before shaping or cooking."
rolling_tortilla,"Initial state: A portion of dough rests on a lightly floured surface, forming a circular disk. Color: pale beige to off-white (wheat) or yellowish (corn). Texture: soft, pliable, slightly tacky; surface matte with a subtle sheen. Size about 14–18 cm diameter, thickness about 2–3 mm; edges uneven. The person is centering the disk and starting to flatten it with hands or a rolling pin, applying gentle, outward pressure to begin shaping.","Intermediate state: dough stretched into a mostly circular/oval disc, about 6–9 inches in diameter, with a thinner center and a slightly thicker edge. Color pale beige from flour, surface lightly dusted, possibly translucent in very thin spots. Texture is pliable, tacky yet elastic, with faint pinches or creases from rolling. The practitioner rotates the disc, applies even pressure with the rolling pin, re-dusts as needed, and occasionally lifts to check thickness and adjust edges.","End state: a snug cylindrical tortilla roll, about 6–8 inches long and 1–2 inches in diameter, with an even smooth surface. Light golden-brown color with occasional toasty specks; the roll holds its shape, edges tucked, seam along the outside. If filled, filling may show at the ends. The person may slice into coins, plate whole, or wrap/refrigerate for storage."
rolling_sausage,"Initial state: loose, cohesive raw ground-meat mixture with white fat flecks, pink-red color, damp and tacky to the touch; not yet formed. On a work surface, a person scoops a hand-sized portion and lightly pats or presses it into a rough log or rectangle, preparing to roll or wrap, with edges irregular and mass spread.","During rolling, the sausage is an elongated, slightly curved log with irregular cross-sections; diameter varies along its length. Surface is moist and glossy from fat and juices; color ranges from pale pink to light brown where heat has begun; exterior may show faint browning with a slight crackle. Interior remains pliable yet firmer than raw, as fat renders. The handler is nudging, rotating, and pressing to even thickness and prevent sticking and air pockets.","End state: neatly formed sausages in uniform, cylindrical links or a continuous log, with taut, smooth casing. Color ranges from pale pink to pink-brown, depending on meat and curing; surface sheen from fat; uniform diameter; no gaps or air pockets; final texture firm yet springy, with a cohesive crumb when cut. The producer is trimming ends, tying links (if linked), and moving the sausages to a rack, smoker, or tray for cooking, curing, or packaging."
rolling_crust,"Initial state: a small pale-beige dough ball resting on a lightly floured surface. Roughly round, about 5–8 cm across and 2–3 cm high, with a smooth yet tacky surface and a light flour dusting; ivory color with tiny specks, cool to the touch. The baker has just placed the dough and is beginning to flatten it—palm-pressing and gentle fingertip guidance to start shaping into a disk, not yet rolling or stretching.","During rolling, the dough forms a thin sheet, typically circular to oval, with near-uniform thickness. The surface is pale with a light flour dusting; slight sheen where moist, matte where dry. Tiny air pockets may indent the sheet; edges are straighter but still irregular. Minor cracks can appear at thin rims. The roller applies even pressure, rotates the dough, dusts with flour, and lifts/repositions to maintain shape and prevent sticking.","End state: a uniformly thin sheet of dough, smooth surface, clean edges trimmed to fit the pan; consistent thickness (about 2–3 mm); pale beige with a light flour dusting; pliable, not sticky, ready for transfer. The person is likely lifting or placing the sheet into a pie or tart pan, trimming any overhang, and chilling or docking before filling."
rolling_cheese,"Initial state: a single block or wedge of cheese, roughly cuboid to oval, fist-sized to dinner-plate-sized. It has a smooth rind or clean surface, pale ivory to light yellow in color. The texture is firm but pliable, not crumbly. It sits stationary on a flat board. The beginner places both hands on the cheese, aligned to edges or center, ready to apply steady pressure and begin shaping it.","During rolling, the cheese forms a flexible mass that remains cohesive yet deforms under contact. It appears as a pale yellow to golden log with a glossy rind; surface may show ridges and indentations from hands or rolling tool. The diameter shifts as pressure is applied, creating a tapered or uneven cross-section. The texture ranges from soft and pliant to firm yet pliable, with a moisture sheen. The roller’s hands drift along its length, guiding, rotating, and re-pressing.","End state: a neat, uniform cylindrical log (or wheel) of cheese with a smooth surface and tight rind, pale ivory to light amber color depending on variety. The texture is firm but sliceable, not crumbling. Size matches the batch. The finished cheese rests on a clean surface or rack, ready for aging or packaging. The worker may wrap it in cheesecloth or wax, apply a label, and move it to aging shelves or a cooler."
zesting_lemon,"Initial state: a whole lemon, about 2–3 inches long, oval to oblong, with bright yellow, taut, dimpled rind and a glossy finish. No zest has been removed; the skin shows its textured surface. A microplane or citrus zester hovers at the rind’s edge, its blade just in contact or about to contact. The person steadies the lemon with one hand and positions the tool with the other, applying light, even pressure to initiate contact.","Mid-zest stage, the lemon surface bears patches where the yellow rind has been removed, revealing pale underlayers. Fragments of zest—thin curls or fine shavings—collect on the grater or plate, glossy and slightly oily. The strips vary in width and length, some curling as they lift, others remaining flat. The hand steadies and rotates the fruit to expose more rind while the other guides the tool and gathers zest.","End state: a small mound or handful of bright yellow lemon zest, free of white pith, composed of fine shreds or microflakes, 1–3 mm wide or very thin curls; oily sheen from citrus oils; aroma vivid, texture delicate and fluffy to slightly crumbly. Color ranges bright yellow to pale gold. The person may then whisk it into batter, fold into a sauce, or sprinkle over a finished dish as garnish."
zesting_orange,"At the start, a fresh orange sits with intact rind. Size is medium (about 6–7 cm in diameter), round-to-oval, bright orange with a slightly glossy, dimpled skin and visible oil glands. The rind is firm and taut. A hand steadies the fruit or rests on a board as a zester (microplane) just touches the rind, signaling the beginning of zesting.","Intermediate zesting state shows uneven ribbons and irregular shreds of bright orange rind accumulating around the tool. Thin, flexible strips curl as citrus oils sheen their surfaces; tiny shavings disperse in a fine dust along the cutting edge. The exposed zest is mostly orange, with a pale, fibrous rind near the white pith. The person alternates grip and pressure, guiding a peeler or zester across the fruit, rotating to access fresh patches, scraping lightly to avoid pith.","End state: collected zest appears as bright orange shavings—fine threads or curls, or small granules—ranging in thickness about 0.5–2 mm, length up to several cm (often shorter with a microplane). The pieces have a glossy oil sheen and no white pith. Color is vivid orange; texture is dry to slightly oily. The person finished zesting is likely transferring zest to a bowl or recipe, or smelling/using it as they continue cooking."
zesting_lime,"At the start, the lime is whole and intact: roughly 3–4 cm in diameter, oval to spherical, with a bright green, glossy, slightly dimpled rind. The rind’s zest sits atop a thinner, pale white pith beneath. A microplane or citrus zester is held near the fruit; one hand grips the lime, the other rests the tool at a shallow angle, preparing to engage the rind with light pressure, the fruit cool and firm to the touch.","Mid-zest: the lime's rind is partly shaved, revealing patches of glossy green and pale pith beneath. Fine curls or thin strips lift from the fruit, winding into loose spirals or ragged flakes. The zest pieces vary in length and thickness; some delicate shavings, others wider ribbons. The surface feels oily and fragrant; edges are rough and slightly damp from juice. One hand rotates the lime while the other guides the tool, collecting bits on the board.","End state: lime zest appears as bright green, fragrant shavings or fine curls, typically 1–3 mm thick if grated or a few mm if ribboned. Pieces are free of white pith, moist with essential oils, and clumped into a loose pile or scattered across a bowl. The zest is usually uniform in color and texture, not browned. The finished person may be scooping the zest into a recipe or moving on to juice or seasoning."
zesting_citrus,"Initial state: a citrus fruit, round to oval, palm-sized to small, bright yellow or orange rind, slightly textured, with a thin glossy oil sheen. The outer peel is intact and has not yet been removed. A hand holds a microplane or citrus peeler and the blade is just touching the rind at a shallow angle, starting to skim the surface.","During zesting, citrus skin yields thin, curlable strips and wispy shavings. The zest is bright orange (or yellow) with a glossy, oily sheen; edges range from smooth to slightly ragged. Strips are about 2–4 cm long and 1–3 mm wide, sometimes curly, with tiny specks of pale pith where the tool catches it. The surface is moist and oily from essential oils. The person uses a microplane or peeler, applying steady pressure and light rotation to lift zest.","End state: zest appears as thin ribbons or fine shreds of citrus rind, bright yellow/orange/green, depending on variety. Strips are 1 to 5 cm long, very thin and pliable, with a glossy, oily surface, largely free of pith, and highly fragrant. The person finished zesting is likely adding it to a recipe, measuring or sprinkling zest into a dish, or cleaning the tool."
zesting_grapefruit,"Whole grapefruit, about 9–10 cm diameter, round to slightly oblate, bright yellow-orange rind with a dimpled, glossy texture. The rind is intact and unrevealed. A handheld grater/zester hovers ready in one hand while the other steadies the fruit on a cutting board; the tool’s edge is positioned to begin at the rind’s surface with light pressure, about to start grating the zest.","During zesting in progress, grapefruit surfaces show bright yellow or orange patches where zest has been removed and exposed citrus pulp; remaining rind forms uneven ridges. Long, curled strips and fine shavings collect on the grater and bench, with glossy citrus oil beading on the zest and board. The zester or microplane is angled to shave off the colored zest while avoiding the white pith, and the person rotates the fruit, applying pressure and scraping in short, deliberate motions.","End state: bright yellow-orange grapefruit zest in fine shreds or curls, uniformly sized, lightly oily with citrus oils. The rind is zest-free; the surface is pale. A small pile or bowl holds the zest, ready for use. The person finished with zesting would likely add it to a dish or batter, use it as garnish, or transfer it to a container, then clean the tools."
zesting_clementine,"An intact clementine sits small and round (about 2.5–3.5 cm diameter) with a bright orange, smooth yet slightly dimpled rind. The rind looks glossy, with visible oil glands; the white pith peeks at the seam. A zester or paring knife is poised at the fruit’s curve in the hand, the person steadying the citrus and applying gentle pressure to the rind, ready to begin scraping.","During zesting a clementine, the rind yields bright orange zest curls and ribbons; some short flakes, some long strips, with a glistening oil sheen. Pith remains mostly unseen beneath sparse white layers. Shavings vary in thickness and curl as the grater or microplane is rotated and pressed, leaving a stray pile and scattered zest on the cutting surface. The person twists the fruit, angles the tool, and collects zest while avoiding puncturing into the pith.","End state: Clementine zest shavings or ribbons, 1–2 mm thick, curled or flat, with no white pith. The zest is dry but oily to the touch, highly aromatic, and bright orange. Collected in a small bowl or measuring spoon, ready to be added to a dish. The person finished zesting is likely transferring the zest to the bowl, measuring it, or starting to mix it into batter or garnish."
squeezing_lemon,"Initial state: a whole lemon, palm-sized, bright yellow rind, smooth to slightly dimpled texture, evenly colored with fine pores and a few tiny blemishes. It feels firm but springy to light pressure. The person begins by grasping the fruit with fingers curled around the rind and the thumb poised on top, steadying it in the palm to apply squeezing pressure.","During squeezing, the lemon half deforms under palm pressure: the rind puckers, remains bright yellow, and darkens slightly; edges compress to a cupped curve, and the cut face becomes glossier with wet juice, and the surface widens as pulp loosens. Juice beads collect and begin to stream from segments; pulp loosens, membranes appear translucent, and tiny seeds may ride the liquid. The person’s grip tightens, hand rotates, and wrist flexes to apply more pressure, palms slick with juice.","End state: a squeezed lemon half with the rind bright yellow and slightly puckered; interior membranes collapsed and mostly devoid of juice, leaving a dry, spongy pulp core. Any collected juice appears as a translucent, pale-yellow pool in a nearby bowl or measuring cup, with a few seeds. The person finished with squeezing might be pouring the juice, scraping residue into the container, or wiping hands and placing the rind aside."
squeezing_lime,"Initial state: a whole lime, about 3–4 cm in diameter, roughly spherical with a slightly flattened top. The rind is bright green, pebbled and glossy, firm to the touch. No cuts or juice visible. The person is just starting to grip it—fingers wrapped around the citrus, one hand stabilizing while the other prepares to press downward.","Mid-squeeze lime: the rind remains bright green, the cut surface or wedge now slick with citrus oil, glistening droplets bead along the lip. The exposed pulp appears translucent and fibrous, with juice threads visible as pressure is applied. The fruit compresses, flattening to reveal dimples and indentations; juice pools and beads on the skin. The person may grip the lime, apply downward pressure with knuckles tensed, rotate slightly, and maintain steady squeeze.","End state: squeezed lime halves collapsed, with exposed pulp and membranes; most juice drained. A pale green–yellow liquid sits in a cup or bowl, translucent with a thin foam. The rind stays green and intact but wrinkled or dry to the touch. The juiced fruit is set aside or discarded; the person might pour the juice into a drink or recipe, or wipe up spills."
squeezing_orange,"An intact orange: roughly 2.5–3 inches in diameter, round to slightly oval, bright orange skin with fine dimples, firm yet yielding to touch, no splits or juice. The fruit is uncut and unbroken. The person is about to engage: hands positioned around the fruit, fingers curved and thumbs opposing, wrist steady, preparing to apply pressure.","During the squeezing process, the orange deforms from round to a flattened, oblong shape as the rind dents under fingers. The size reduces; the skin darkens slightly where pressure is concentrated. The surface becomes glossy and damp from citrus oil, with fine wrinkles forming along the pressed areas. Juice beads and seeps at the seams. The person applies downward pressure, sometimes twisting or rolling the fruit to coax juice.","End state: A glass or pitcher of bright orange juice, slightly opaque with pulp strands; surface glossy with droplets. The squeezed orange renders a punctured or split rind and a hollow, flattened fruit, with residual dry pulp around the cavity. Color vivid orange; liquid is smooth to moderately pulpy. The person finished might be pouring, sipping, wiping hands, or setting the glass down and cleaning the juicer."
squeezing_garlic,"Initially, a single garlic clove in dry, papery skin. The clove is oval-teardrop shaped, about 1–2 cm long and 0.5–1 cm wide, pale ivory with faint purple skin markings. The surface is smooth and firm; the skin is slightly translucent and flaky. The person is just starting to squeeze by lightly pinching the clove between thumb and forefinger or placing it in a garlic press, with no crush yet.","During squeezing, garlic cloves loosen their skins and fracture into irregular pieces of varying size. The mash is damp and chunky, white to pale-yellow as oils are released. The surface becomes glossy and slightly translucent, with moisture beads and occasional fibers. Papery skins cling to the tool, while some bits collapse into mush and others stay coarse. The person applies downward pressure, twists or grinds, scraping to collect paste and release oils and droplets.","End state of squeezing garlic: a pale ivory to pale yellow minced paste, with very small, uniform particles or a smooth puree. It is moist and slightly oily, often translucent at the edges, with no visible clove shapes. The mass sits as a small mound or touches the pan. After squeezing, the person might sauté it in oil, stir it into a sauce, or scrape the paste into a skillet or bowl, then clean the press."
squeezing_potato,"Initial state: a fresh medium potato, oval to oblong, about fist-sized (6–8 cm), brown papery skin with dirt specks, eyes visible, firm and dense with no soft spots. Onset of squeezing: the person grips it with one hand, fingers curling around the sides, thumb opposite, light preparatory pressure beginning, palm stabilizing as contact is made.","During squeezing, the potato takes on irregular, dented contours: flattened lobes, ridges, and valleys; the profile becomes asymmetric and squashed, with a slightly softer, yielding feel under the fingertips. The skin may become glassy where pressed, and tiny cracks or wrinkles appear around contact zones. Juicy moisture or starch can bead on the surface. The person presses with fingertips or palms, often cyclically, rotates or shifts grip to distribute pressure and test elasticity, while maintaining continuous compression.","End state: The potato is compressed and misshapen with a flattened profile; the surface is damp and shiny, and exposed flesh is pale yellow while skin may patchily remain. The mass is soft, mushy, and sloppy, with reduced volume and no defined edge. After squeezing, the person may scoop the pulp into a bowl, rinse their hands, and proceed to mash, peel, or otherwise discard or repurpose the squeezed potato."
squeezing_spinach,"Initial state: Fresh spinach leaves, intact and loosely bundled; leaves bright to dark green, crisp, with visible veins; surface slightly glossy, possibly with water droplets from washing; slender pale stems. Just as squeezing begins, a person lifts a small handful, aligns the stems, and centers the leaves in the palm, fingers lightly closing around the base to grip without applying pressure yet.","In progress, spinach leaves are damp and crumpled, folding into a compact bundle. Color is a deeper green with glossy, translucent wet patches and occasional yellowing at edges. The leaves appear puckered and twisted; edges curl as capacity to hold water increases. Juice beads on surfaces; the texture is slippery and fibrous, with soft stem fragments. The person is twisting, wringing, and pressing the bundle—often rotating hands or squeezing in a cloth to extract moisture, repeatedly.","End state: A compact, wrung-out mass of dark green spinach leaves, damp but not dripping, formed into a dense clump or flattened puck. Color remains deep emerald with a slightly glossy surface; stems are shortened and the tissue appears tender and pliable, with a fibrous, leaf-pulp texture. The volume is reduced compared with fresh spinach. The person has finished squeezing and is likely to sauté it, fold it into a filling, or mix it into a dish."
squeezing_avocado,"Initial state: a whole avocado (oval/pear-shaped, about 7–12 cm) with dark, slightly pebbled skin; or a halved fruit exposing pale yellow-green flesh and a removed pit. The surface is firm to the touch if unripe, or yields slightly if ripe. In this moment, the person cradles or lifts the fruit with both hands, fingers curved around the sides, thumbs ready to apply light pressure—no squeezing has begun yet.","During squeezing, the flesh is partially crushed and malleable, forming irregular lobes with shallow indentations. The color shifts from bright green to olive where mashed, with wet sheen and visible fiber. Chunks remain in softer, mushy areas, giving a heterogeneous texture. The exterior skin is still present at the edges. The person is applying pressure with fingers or a utensil, smoothing, folding, and rotating to break apart the flesh and distribute moisture.","End state: a smooth, spoonable green paste—uniform olive-to-lime color, glossy surface, and creamy, velvety to lightly chunky texture; compact mound or dollop about a small scoop in size with minimal liquid. It may resemble spread on bread or a base for guacamole. After squeezing, the person might be spreading it on toast, folding it into a dish, or seasoning before serving."
squeezing_zucchini,"Initial state: a fresh zucchini, elongated cylindrical shape about 6 to 8 inches, even width with a slight taper at ends. Skin is dark green, smooth and glossy, with no blemishes. The flesh is firm and crisp to the touch; cool to the palm. The person begins by picking up one zucchini, holding it in one hand, and applying light pressure with fingertips to test firmness, while turning it to inspect the surface.","During ongoing squeezing, the zucchini deforms under pressure: the once-smooth cylinder develops pinches and ridges along its length. The green skin remains, but a damp sheen and small juice beads highlight contact points. The flesh near pressed areas looks slightly translucent and fibrous, and the length appears subtly shortened as it yields. The person keeps a firm grip with fingers and palm, applies steady pressure, sometimes twists or rolls to direct moisture outward, or wrings it with a towel.","End state: a zucchini that’s squeezed is flattened and compact, often disk- or pill-shaped, with reduced volume. The green skin remains visible; the interior flesh is pale and fibrous. The texture is dry to the touch, with most moisture expelled—any dampness clinging to the surface or the squeezing cloth. The user might pat it dry, drain it in a cloth or colander, then chop, grate, or add it to a recipe."
squeezing_tomato,"Initial state: A ripe, palm-sized tomato resting over a cutting board. Round to slightly flattened, 4–7 cm diameter. Skin smooth, taut, glossy red with a small green stem scar at the crown. Surface appears firm to the touch with even color and faint ridges near the top. The hand holds the fruit with a light grip at its sides; fingertips and thumb poised to apply pressure, but no deformation yet.","During squeezing, the tomato's skin puckers and wrinkles where pressure concentrates. The shape flattens and bulges as fingertips indent and push inward. Juices bead and run, dampening the surface; color may deepen at pressed areas. Internal pulp becomes visible through slight tears; seeds may appear near the breach. The person applies sustained fingertip or palm pressure, often rolling or twisting to extract juice into a container.","End state: A crushed tomato forms a flattened, irregular mass of red pulp with released juice; skins torn, seeds visible or dispersed; texture ranges from thick puree to watery mush; color deep red to orange-red with liquid pooling on the surface. What they might be doing next: transferring the pulp to a bowl or pot, straining or cooking it, and washing hands or the squeezing tool."
squeezing_grapefruit,"Initial state: a whole grapefruit, about 4 inches in diameter, round-to-oval, with a thick, taut rind; color ranges from yellow to pale orange, slightly glossy and pebbled. The fruit is firm yet yields a mild give when pressed, signaling ripeness. The person starting to squeeze typically holds the fruit in one hand (fingers wrapped around the sides, thumb at the top), preparing to apply pressure.","Mid-squeeze, the grapefruit shows localized deformation: the rind puckers and bulges where fingers press, so the round fruit becomes irregularly oval. The surface remains yellow-orange, but pressed zones may look slightly darker and glossier as juice beads form and moisture pools. You can feel a firm yet yielding give beneath the skin, with faint seams or wrinkles where the segments push outward. The person grips with palm and fingertips, rotating or shifting pressure to maintain contact and coax juice.","End state: The juiced grapefruit appears flattened and deformed, with a wrinkled rind and a damp, glossy interior. The rind may darken slightly; flesh segments are exposed or collapsed, with remaining juice beads on moist pulp. The fruit is visibly lighter in volume. The juiced fruit may be resting or set aside, while the person is wiping hands, pouring juice into a container, or discarding the rind."
squeezing_cabbage,"Initial state: a whole cabbage head, round to oval, about 6–8 inches across, with tight, crisp green leaves wrapping a pale core. Outer leaves are glossy, green with white veins, some slight crinkling, but intact; the head feels firm and heavy. The person is just starting to squeeze: cradling the head with both hands, lifting or rotating it, and perhaps peeling away a loose outer leaf to access the center.","During squeezing, the cabbage mass flattens and becomes irregular as pressure is applied; the green outer leaves wrinkle and shift, and inner leaves loosen, with the pale core showing through. The surface is damp and slightly slick with released juice; fibers loosen and some shreds detach, mixing with the moisture. The volume decreases as liquid exits, leaving a softer, pliable, mottled block. The person presses with palms and fingers, sometimes twisting or wringing sections to continue extraction.","End state: a compact, damp mass of cabbage shreds, pale green to yellow, with translucent edges. The surface is glossy from remaining moisture; the mass holds a rough wedge or block shape and shows little free liquid, though a small pool may remain. The cabbage has been drained and squeezed dry. The person may be transferring the squeezed cabbage into a jar or bowl for fermentation or salting, then wiping their hands."
squeezing_ginger,"Initial state: A fresh ginger rhizome—knobby and irregular, about 2–4 inches long. Tan-brown skin, thin and slightly papery; when cut, pale yellow-orange, fibrous flesh is visible. The surface is firm and taut, with a crisp snap feel. The person is just beginning to squeeze by gripping the piece with both hands, thumbs and fingers around the body, applying gentle pressure to test firmness.","As squeezing continues, the ginger's surface darkens where pressure is applied; peeled tissue becomes pliable and compresses into a flattened, irregular disk. Juice beads at incisions and pools along the edges. Interior fibers fray, releasing stringy strands that cling to fingers, leaving a tacky, pale yellow-orange residue. The piece dents under pressure, develops creases and cavities, and emits a sharp, citrusy aroma as the hand twists, rolls, and presses.","End state: A damp, compact ginger pulp—pale yellow-brown, fibrous and sticky—with a thin sheen of pressed juice on the surface; any liquid has pooled in a nearby container. The squeezed mass is a small, cohesive lump. The person finished may be tilting a bowl to collect juice, scraping the pulp into a dish, or wiping their hands."
squeezing_cucumber,"Initial state of squeezing cucumber: a whole cucumber, elongated and straight, about 15–20 cm long and 3–4 cm in diameter. Skin is glossy green with tiny speckles and a subtle waxy sheen. It feels firm yet springy, with moderate resistance. The cucumber may rest on a surface or be held; in the starting moment, one hand is nearby and the other begins to contact the skin, applying light, tentative pressure with fingertips, producing no visible deformation yet.","Mid-squeeze, the cucumber shows localized compression with creases and bulges along its skin. The profile narrows where pressed and swells where grip relaxes, with the surface becoming matte as moisture releases. The color remains green; some wetness forms on the skin. The person is pressing, twisting, or wringing with one or both hands, shifting grip to vary pressure and extract juice or soften the texture.","End state of squeezing cucumber: a flattened, softened mass with a puckered, irregular shape. The former round cross-section compressed into a deformed oval; shrinkage reduces apparent size. Skin is duller green, possibly wrinkled, with moist, juice-soaked surface and tiny tears at the cut ends. Texture transitions from crisp to soft and pliable; seeds may become more noticeable. After squeezing, the person might continue cooking, squeeze other vegetables, dice or grate, or rinse and wipe hands."
squeezing_onion,"Initial state: an intact onion, with dry papery skin, taut outer layers; spherical to slightly flattened globe, 5–8 cm diameter depending on cultivar; color white, yellow, or red, with a firm, dense, crisp texture. Just starting to squeeze: hands hover around the skin, fingers and thumbs press gently at the surface, creating a shallow, immediate dimpling without cutting or peeling; no juice leakage yet, nails lightly gripping, weight balanced, fingertips feeling resistance.","While squeezing is in progress, the onion deforms under pressure: the contact face flattens, a shallow indentation forms, and the opposite side bulges. The skin tightens and wrinkles where pressed, revealing glossy, translucent inner layers. Moisture beads on the surface; juice darkens the creases. The color shifts from matte pale yellow-white to a shinier, more saturated hue at stressed zones. The person grips with palm or fingers, applying steady pressure and sometimes twisting or kneading to spread the squeeze.","End state: the onion has been pressed into a wet, mashed mass of fibrous, irregular fragments. The bulk is flattened, with most liquid exuded as pale translucent juice. Color ranges from pale white to pale yellow or pinkish depending on variety; texture is mushy, pulpy, and slippery, with few intact layers. The person finished squeezing might strain or pour off juice, collect pulp for paste, or add it to a recipe."
squeezing_tofu,"Initial state: a block of firm or extra-firm tofu rests in its dish or packaging, pale ivory, smooth surface, rectangular prism about 3×2×1 inches (roughly 120 g). Moisture beads on the skin; cool and slightly spongy to the touch. It is unpressed and unaltered. A person’s hands begin to grasp the block—palms on opposite faces, thumbs at the edges—preparing to apply gentle pressure.","As pressure is applied, the tofu block compresses into a denser, slightly elongated form with flattened edges and shallow surface creases. The interior fibers tighten, shifting from spongy to firmer, springy. The color darkens slightly and becomes more opaque as moisture is expelled. A film of liquid appears on the surface or on a towel and may bead. The person uses hands or a towel to press, twist, and rotate to drain evenly.","End state: a firm, dense, compact block (usually rectangular) with pale white color. Surface dry and smooth, with minimal moisture. Texture is firm and springy, not mushy. After squeezing, the person may pat it dry, cut into cubes or slabs, then marinate and cook (stir-fry, fry, or bake)."

Surfaces show uneven browning, with pale gray-brown patches transitioning to honeyed brown. Edges curl and render small crisps as fat pools and sizzles. The texture shifts from plump, moist to slightly crisper, with surface moisture evaporating. A gentle, steady hiss accompanies bubbling as juices migrate outward. The cook flips and nudges pieces for even color.","End state: sausage is fully browned with a rich tan to dark brown surface, crisp edges, and a caramelized crust. Exterior may be crisp; interior fully cooked (no pink), juicy, with rendered fat integrated. Size may shrink slightly from fat loss; shape is irregular if crumbled or formed into links or patties. The cook may drain fat, plate, rest, or add it to a pan sauce or dish."
browning_butter,"In the pan, butter sits as pale yellow, solid chunks or pats, about 1–2 cm thick. The surface is glossy, with no significant liquid yet; edges may be just starting to soften as the heat comes up. A tiny pool of melted fat may cling at the bottom, but most of the butter remains solid. The cook is likely turning on medium heat and placing the pieces into the skillet, possibly cutting or spacing them for even melting.","Mid-browning butter shows a shimmering, translucent pool of melted fat with intermittent white foam on the surface. Milk solids swirl and separate, sinking to form specks that gradually take on amber-brown edges. Bubbles grow smaller, the liquid becomes richer and more viscous; the color shifts from pale yellow to gold and then to light amber. The aroma deepens as toasty notes appear. The cook tilts and swirls the pan, skims foam, and nudges the pan for even heat.","End state: a smooth, glossy pool of browned butter—the color ranges from amber to deep brown—with a nutty aroma. The liquid fat is pourable and slightly viscous; toasted milk solids may be visible as tiny brown specks, either suspended or settled at the bottom of the pan. The surface forms a thin, shallow pool rather than a solid mass. The cook may be pouring it into a sauce, finishing a dish, or drizzling over components."
browning_crust,"Initial browning crust appears as tiny irregular brown patches on a pale cream surface; patches are scattered, about 1–3 mm across, with color from pale beige to light amber. The surface remains soft and slightly tacky, with irregular, patchy shapes and no crispness yet. The baker has just exposed the dough to heat (in the oven) or begun applying a glaze/heat to initiate browning.","Intermediate browning crust shows a developing, uneven surface: golden to amber patches with darker rims; center lighter, can be off-white or tan. Surface may be pale matte before fully drying, then glossy where fats/moisture remains. Texturally, it transitions from soft to crisp, with fine cracks and occasional blisters; edges may curl. Crust expands slightly as moisture escapes. Steam or vapour escapes, leaving a dry, crackly feel. The cook keeps heat steady, rotates, and brushes or baste for even color.","End state of browning crust: the surface is uniformly golden to deep brown, often amber to mahogany, with a crisp, dry, crackly exterior. Texture shows slight blistering and flaky layers where applicable, and a firm bite. Edges remain intact and slightly darker; overall color is even with minimal pale spots. A light sheen from natural fats may be present. The baker is cooling the baked item on a rack, then ready to slice or serve."
browning_bacon,"Initial state: bacon slices laid flat in a skillet, still raw as heat is applied. Shapes are long, straight strips with uniform width; meat color pinkish-red, fat white and opaque. Surface is moist and slightly glossy, not yet dry. Slices are pliable, not curled or crisp. The person has just placed the strips in the pan and started heating, allowing the fat to begin rendering and the meat to warm.","During browning, bacon shows patchy browns from golden to deep amber; fat renders, turning translucent and pooling as strips shrink and curl; edges lift and become crisper while centers remain supple, creating a contrast of textures. The surface becomes glossy with released oil; sizzle and tiny bubbles mark moisture loss. The cook uses tongs to flip, reposition, and separate strips to promote even browning and prevent sticking.","End state: evenly browned to golden‑brown or deeper amber, with crisp, crackly texture. Edges curl and shrink slightly; surface shows rendered fat with a light sheen; meat is firm with a crisp snap, not rubbery. Slight color variation from lighter centers to darker rims. After browning, the cook drains on paper towels and plates the bacon, often serving with eggs or in a dish, while saving the fat for reuse."
browning_pork,"Initial browning state: pork pieces in a single layer, varying shapes and sizes (slices or cubes). Outer edges show the first faint browning; the centers remain pink with surface moisture and a light sheen. Fat rims stay pale. The meat feels firm but pliable. A faint sizzle from the hot pan signals contact with oil. The cook has just placed the pieces down, patting dry and avoiding crowding.","Pieces show partial Maillard browning: surfaces mottled from pale-tan to golden-brown with darker edge points. Some areas are crisp, others remain slightly soft and moist. Fat renders at the margins, glistening. Shrinkage and slight curling occur as moisture evaporates. Pan sizzle persists; spatula or tongs are used to flip or rearrange pieces to maintain even contact and browning.","End state: pork pieces have an even Maillard crust from light golden to dark brown, with crisp, well-defined edges; size and shape match the cut. Exterior is dry and slightly tacky; surface shows caramelized bits (fond). The interior continues to cook to doneness; after browning, the cook may rest, deglaze, slice/serve, or add to a dish."
browning_meatball,"Initial browning state: meatballs are roughly spherical, about the size formed (no change in overall dimensions yet). Exterior begins to color to a light tan or gray-brown; interior remains pink. The surface may glisten with a thin layer of rendered fat and moisture. A gentle sizzling is audible as the bottom makes contact with a hot pan. A beginner might be preheating oil in a skillet, shaping a meatball, and carefully lowering it into the pan without crowding.","Intermediate browning shows a roughly spherical meatball with a slightly flattened contact area from the pan. Size may shrink a bit as surface moisture evaporates. Exterior color progresses from pale pink to golden-brown with a darker edge and a developing crust; surface becomes dry and slightly crisp where in contact. Juices bead and render fat, while the interior remains tender. The cook is actively turning and repositioning for even sear, adjusting heat, and lifting to check color and pan fond.","End state: A browned, spherical meatball with a compact, crisp crust. Diameter about 1–2 inches, still roughly uniform in shape. Exterior color ranges from golden to dark brown with Maillard crust and slight sear marks; surface is textured, crackled, and firm to the touch. Inside remains moist and tender.

browning_turkey,"Initial state: raw/thawed turkey pieces laid in a hot pan in a single layer. Surfaces are pale pink-gray, moist with a light sheen. Tiny irregular spots begin to tan where contact has started; edges may show faint color, but overall texture remains uncooked. The cook has just added a bit of oil and placed the pieces in contact with the pan, likely pressing gently for full contact and not yet flipped.","During in-progress browning, surfaces appear mottled tan to bronze; the skin tightens as moisture evaporates. A thin, savory crust forms where pan heat concentrates; edges curl and crisp. Fat renders, droplets hiss on the surface, and juices glisten. The meat firms yet remains moist beneath. The cook may flip pieces, move them to even heat, baste with pan juices, or adjust heat to maintain sizzle without scorching.","End state: the turkey or cut shows uniform golden-brown to deep bronze skin, crisp and tight with rendered fat sheen and occasional caramelized spots. The surface is dry to the touch, not pale, and the overall form remains recognizable though slightly smaller due to shrinkage. Once browning is complete, the cook is likely resting or tenting the meat, transferring to the oven or carving."
browning_steak,"Initial state: the steak lies flat, a uniform, thick block with a moist, shiny surface; interior remains red-pink. Where the pan first contacts, a few tiny brownish specks appear and a pale glaze forms on the top surface as heat begins. A sizzle starts but the crust is not yet formed. Beginning action: pat dry, heat a heavy pan until hot, add oil, lay steak in gently and leave it to sear without moving.","During browning, the steak’s surface shifts from red/purple to pink-brown and then to deep brown as Maillard crust forms. A dry, crisp crust appears where it contacts the pan; fat renders and pools along the edges. Juices surface as steam bubbles rise; the steak may flex or flatten under heat. The cook maintains heat, watches color, nudges with tongs, and rotates or presses lightly for even sear and crust development.","End state: The steak has a crisp, deeply browned crust with a uniform tan-to-mahogany color, a firm outer surface, and distinct sear marks. The interior has reached the target doneness, with juices largely contained. The steak’s shape remains roughly the cut’s original outline; size slightly reduced by moisture loss. The cook may be resting it, slicing against the grain, or deglazing the pan and plating."
browning_potato,"Initial state (before browning): raw potato pieces—uniform shape (slices or cubes), about 1 cm, firm, pale white to pale yellow, smooth waxy surface, slightly moist. Just starting to brown: faint tan specks at edges where heat first acts, surface still mostly pale. A beginner might be cutting/dicing, patting dry, and preheating a skillet with a splash of oil, ready to add the pieces.","During browning, potato pieces exhibit a gradient from pale to golden as surface moisture evaporates. Edges develop a thin, slightly blistered crust while centers stay partly translucent and soft. The pieces may curl or shrink marginally; surfaces look glossy and then begin to matte as crispness forms. A sizzle and bubble activity persists around oil-exposed faces. The cook is flipping, shuffling, and adjusting heat, sometimes sprinkling salt or adding oil to maintain contact.","End state: uniformly browned potato pieces with a crisp, crackly exterior and a tender interior. Color ranges from golden to deep amber/brown; surface shows a light oil sheen and little moisture. Shapes remain as cut (wedges or chunks); size unchanged, but edges are crisp and slightly curled.

The cook bastes, rotates, monitors the internal temperature, and may tent with foil to promote even browning.","End state: a whole roasted turkey with glossy, golden-brown skin that’s crisp and evenly bronzed. The meat appears plump and fully cooked; breast meat pale and opaque, dark meat tender. Skin may crack slightly where carved; juices bead on the surface, and a thermometer reads 165°F at the thickest part. The cook, finished, rests the bird tented with foil and then carves or presents it on a platter."
roasting_chickpea,"Initial state: dried raw chickpeas, 6–8 mm across, irregular round to kidney-shaped discs. Color pale beige, matte, uniform; surface hard and dense, dry to the touch. No oil, seasoning, or browning yet. In the kitchen, the person is beginning prep—rinsing and draining, patting dry, preheating a pan or oven, ready to spread chickpeas in a single layer.","Intermediate roasted chickpeas show a pale beige base with speckled golden-tan patches. Surfaces become wrinkled and slightly bumpy, with tiny cracks near the hilum. A faint oil sheen may appear if oil is used; a light crackling can occur as moisture escapes. They swell modestly, becoming firmer and crisper to the bite. The cook is tilting, stirring, or shaking the pan to promote even browning and prevent sticking.","End state: chickpeas are dry, crisp, and firm with a uniform golden-brown to amber color and lightly wrinkled, crackly skin. They’re small, roughly disk-shaped, about 0.6–1 cm across, with no surface moisture. Texture is dense yet brittle, with an audible crunch. The cook is likely cooling on a rack, then tossing with salt/spices or packaging for storage."
roasting_corn,"Initial state: raw corn, either on the cob with husk removed or kernels loosened. Color pale yellow to ivory; smooth, glossy kernels, oval/elongated about 5–7 mm long; plump, tightly packed on the cob or laid in a single layer; still raw. The cook is just placing the corn on a hot pan, grill, or comal, arranging it for even contact—no browning or scorching yet, just heat contact beginning.","As roasting continues, kernels blister and puff, shifting from pale yellow to deep golden-brown with uneven specks of darker caramel. Shapes become irregular: some plump and rounded, others split or puckered along the surface. The texture shifts from firm to drier and crackling, with visible surface oil, sear marks, and occasional char. Steam escapes, aromas intensify. The roaster twists, stirs, or tilts the pan, and adjusts heat to promote even browning while monitoring popping.","End state: roasted corn presents as plump kernels tightly on the cob, swollen and blistered, hues ranging from bright golden to deep amber with some charred edges. The surface glistens with melted butter or oil, kernels tender yet with a slight bite, the cob remains sturdy. The person finished roasting may be slicing kernels off the cob, brushing with butter, and plating or eating, or letting the cobs rest briefly before serving."
roasting_asparagus,"Initial state: raw, unroasted asparagus spears—green, slender, 4 to 9 inches long, straight or slightly curved, firm with smooth, glossy skin; tips tight; woody ends trimmed; surface damp from washing. The cook is prepping: preheating the oven, rinsing and drying spears, trimming ends, tossing with oil, salt and pepper, and laying them in a single layer on a lined baking sheet.","In-progress asparagus show glossy, oil-slick green stalks that are softening and curving as heat concentrates moisture. Tips blister and turn golden-brown; the skin may wrinkle slightly along the spears. Stems shrink a touch, surfaces gain a crisp edge while interiors stay tender. Steam and a light sizzle rise from the pan. The cook flips and rotates with tongs, occasionally drizzling oil or seasoning for even browning.","End state: 6–8 inch spears with evenly blistered, golden-brown tips and lightly caramelized stalks. Color is bright green with hints of olive; stalks are tender but with a slight bite (knife-tender), not mushy. Surfaces glossy from oil; some crisp edges. After roasting, the cook removes from the oven, rests briefly, plates, and adds finishing touches (salt, pepper, lemon juice, Parmesan, or herbs) before serving."
roasting_broccoli,"Initial state (pre-roast): raw broccoli florets with tightly closed buds, bright green crowns and pale stems; firm, crisp, and slightly moist to the touch; florets about 1–2 cm across; stems 2–5 cm long; no browning or softening. The cook is preparing: washing and drying, trimming ends, separating into uniform pieces, tossing with oil and seasonings, and spreading on a sheet in a single layer before heating.","As the roast progresses, broccoli florets show browning at tips with crisp edges; color shifts from bright emerald to olive-green and brown specks. The outer surfaces blister and dry slightly, while the centers stay tender yet firmer than raw. Florets may curl or puff where moisture escapes; stems soften but resist breakdown. Size shrinks a bit from moisture loss. The cook is flipping or tossing on the sheet, drizzling or re-spreading oil, and checking for even browning.","End state of roasted broccoli: florets retain a crown-like shape but are slightly shrunk; color is vibrant green with caramelized brown edges and a few charred spots; surfaces are glossy from oil; texture is crisp-tender with tender stems, florets lightly shriveled but cohesive; aroma is toasty and nutty; size remains largely similar with minor reduction. The person finished with roasting might plate, drizzle with lemon, and serve."
roasting_squash,"Initial state before roasting: Raw squash, either whole or cut into chunks; shapes include wedges, rounds, or blocks; sizes range roughly 2–4 inches; skin varies by variety (green, orange, yellow, or white); flesh pale cream and firm; surface dry with intact seeds inside cavities. The person is preparing: washing, trimming ends, quartering or slicing, scooping seeds, and preheating the oven, then readying a tray with oil.","In progress, squash pieces glisten with oil as heat intensifies. Edges darken to golden-brown, with some caramelization on the rims; skins blister and separate from flesh. Flesh softens and yields to gentle pressure, moisture condenses on the surface, and size shrinks slightly from evaporation. The shape remains recognizable, though corners may curl. The cook is tossing or flipping pieces on a sheet, seasoning, watching for even browning, and possibly basting with oil or turning trays to ensure uniform heat.","End state: The squash is tender all the way through; flesh is bright orange, creamy, and scoopable. Caramelized brown edges on exposed surfaces. If whole, the skin is tender; if cut, the surfaces glisten with released moisture and oils. The squash will be slightly shrunken due to moisture loss. The person finished roasting may scoop, mash, or purée the flesh, or plate it with oil and seasonings."
roasting_beet,"Initial state: raw beets—round to oblong roots, about 5–7 cm across, with earthy, muddy skin; colors range deep red‑purple (red beets) or golden; skins intact, firm and dense; greens may be attached or removed. A beginner washes and scrubs, trims tops and ends, pats dry, and perhaps peels. They may then cut into uniform wedges or halves, toss with oil and salt, and preheat the oven.","During roasting, beets—often whole or halved—show tight, glistening skins with slight cracking and a rosy to deep magenta hue. Steam escapes as sugars caramelize; interior flesh transitions from firm to yielding, with color shifting toward ruby-brown in exposed areas. Size may shrink as moisture evaporates; edges blister. The roaster rotates the tray, brushes oil, and tests tenderness with a fork or knife, while heat and airflow drive browning.","End state: Beets retain their general round to oblong shape, slightly smaller with wrinkled, glossy red-purple skin. Flesh is uniformly deep pink to burgundy, very tender and creamy, with little resistance when pierced; juices may bead. Exterior caramelization may occur on edges. The finished person might unwrap foil, let beets cool briefly, then peel skins, slice or dice, and dress with oil, salt, and herbs."
roasting_mushroom,"Initial state: raw mushrooms — whole caps with short stems or uniformly sliced; size ranges from small to medium. Color: pale white to light tan, smooth, slightly moist surface; firm, plump, not yet shriveled. They may be rinsed and patted dry; stems trimmed. The beginner often places them in a single layer on a preheated pan (with a little oil or butter) to start roasting.","In progress, mushrooms shrink and reshape as moisture evaporates. Caps blister and curl at the edges, then flatten; surfaces brown from pale gold to deep amber with caramelization. Juices sizzle and glisten, leaving surfaces that range from tacky to dry depending on oil. Texture shifts from plump and firm to tender, with centers becoming more translucent. The cook stirs, flips, and repositions pieces for even browning, and adjusts heat and spacing.","End state: Roasted mushrooms are evenly browned to a deep golden color with caramelized edges. Caps shrink slightly; stems are tender, moisture reduced, and the surface may be glossy from oil. Texture is tender with a subtle bite, not mushy, and flavor intensified by browning. The person finished with roasting might be plating, drizzling finishing oil or butter, and garnishing before serving."
